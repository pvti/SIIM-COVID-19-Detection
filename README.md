<div style="text-align: justify"> Solutions to screen and diagnose positive patients for SARS-CoV-2 promptly and efficiently are critical in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic‚Äôs complex evolution. Recent researches have demonstrated the efficiency of deep learning and particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in classifying and detecting lung disease-related lesions from radiographs. This paper presents a solution using ensemble learning techniques on advanced CNNs to classify as well as localize COVID-19-related abnormalities in radiographs. Two classifiers including EfficientNetV2 and NFNet are combined with three detectors, DETR, Yolov7, and EfficientDet. Along with gathering and training the model on a large number of datasets, image augmentation, and cross-validation are also addressed. Since then, this study has shown promising results and has received excellent marks in the Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine‚Äôs competition. The analysis in model selection for the trade-off between speed and accuracy is also given.
